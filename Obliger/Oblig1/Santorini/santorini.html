        <p class="column"> With multicoloured cliffs soaring over 300m from a sea-drowned caldera, 
          it rests in the middle of the indigo Aegean, looking like a giant slab of layered cake.  
          The island spoons the vast crater left by one of the biggest volcanic eruptions in history. 
          Smaller islands curl around the fragmented western edge of the caldera, 
          but it is the main island of Thira that will take your breath away </p>      

        <p class="column">with its snow drift of white Cycladic houses lining the cliff tops and, in places, 
          spilling like icy cornices down the terraced rock. When the sun sets, the reflection on the buildings 
          and the glow of the orange and red in the cliffs can be truly spectacular. 
          Santorini is no secret and draws crowds for most of the year, yet it wears its tourism well and its 
          offerings make it worth the bustle. </p>

        <p class="column">The island's intrigue reaches deep into the past, with the fascinating Minoan site 
          of Akrotiri and the gorgeous traditional hilltop village of Oia. It also glides effortlessly into the 
          future with accomplished artists, excellent wineries, a unique brewery, and some of the Cyclades finest 
          dining experiences. The sandy, multicoloured beaches are simply the icing on the cake.</p>
